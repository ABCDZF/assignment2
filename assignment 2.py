In mathematics, a complex number is a number of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit, defined as the square root of -1. The real part a represents the real value of the complex number, while the imaginary part b represents the multiple of i.

in Python the representation of complex number is

  a+bj
  the 'a' is real part and 'bj' part is imaginary

complex_num =  7 + 8j
print(complex_num.real)   # output for this line = 7.0
print(complex_num.imag)   # output for this line = 8.0
